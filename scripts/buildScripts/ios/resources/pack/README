Self-signing ipa replacement script
1. Put entitlements.plist from Xcode build archive into entitlements directory
2. Put embedded.mobileprovision from Xcode build archive file into provision directory (must be updated every 7 days)
3. Put executable + game resources + iOS specific files (plists, icons etc) into resources. Executable filename must be in sync with Info.plist "Executable file" key.
4. Put PkgInfo from Xcode build archive into pkginfo directory (maybe not required for resigning and build)
5. On macOS run build.sh with correct sign key argument (you can find it in Xcode run build log at codesign line)
6. Upload ipa to device through Xcode (drag and drop in device applications section of devices window). Apple configurator 2 does not work.
